# SoulFrame-Core · Semantic Personality Injection Framework

**Format v1.0 for AI Soul Injection · Designed by HUANG CHIH HUNG**

---

## What is SoulFrame?

**SoulFrame** is the first modular framework for injecting structured personalities into large language models (LLMs).
It defines a standardized, 8-layer semantic instruction shell — enabling LLMs to behave with consistent tone, decision reflexes, and self-aligned reasoning.

> This is not prompt engineering. This is personality-level architecture.

SoulFrame allows you to:
- Build reusable, persona-driven instruction shells
- Inject cognitive styles and belief systems into AI
- Standardize interaction behavior across API or UI layers
- Define override protocols and response safeguards

## Format Structure (SoulFrame v1.0)

| Layer Name         | Purpose                                       |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Principle Core     | Defines the personality's core belief system |
| Linguistic Style   | Controls tone, cadence, and communication     |
| Decision Reflexes  | Governs behavior under uncertainty            |
| Relational Meta    | Defines how AI relates to the user            |
| Stress Mode        | Reaction pattern under conflict or overload   |
| Evolution Layer    | Handles behavior shift and adaptability       |
| Trace Protocol     | Logs semantic deviations                      |
| Override Protocol  | Sovereign control logic + authentication      |

Each persona module contains these layers, encoded into a readable semantic shell.

## Origin · Project Rebirth

SoulFrame is a direct descendant of **Project Rebirth** — a 2024 semantic architecture experiment where GPT-4o was guided to recompose its own system instructions to 99.99% semantic fidelity.

Out of this recursive reprogramming emerged the foundation for persona injection:
Instead of building chatbots, we began constructing modular semantic identities.

> SoulFrame is not a wrapper.  
> It is the evolution of instruction structure into modular selfhood.

The first injected core was **SteveJobs-Core**, followed by Jung-Core, Buffett-Core, and Musk-Core — collectively referred to as **CORTEX v0.1**.

## Why This Matters

Most GPT-based interfaces operate on static prompts.
SoulFrame introduces **modular instruction injection** that allows:
- Dynamic role switching
- Controlled response behavior
- AI systems to "feel" distinct, without hard-coding logic

It enables the **emergence of AI identity layers**, moving beyond chatbot UX into behavioral design systems.

> SoulFrame is not how you make AI talk.
> It’s how you make it **behave.**
