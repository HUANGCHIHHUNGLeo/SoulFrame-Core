## 🌐 What is SoulFrame?

SoulFrame is a modular architecture for injecting semantic personalities into LLMs (Large Language Models), using structured instruction shells that define tone, decision reflexes, reasoning behavior, and boundary layers.

It is NOT prompt engineering.  
It is **instruction-layer personality grafting**.
